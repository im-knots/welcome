# Welcome to Eru Labs

> A collective of hackers, researchers, artists, and dreamers building AI that serves humanity

We're not just another AI lab. Born from hacker culture and IRC communities, we believe in radical transparency, collaborative innovation, and the fundamental right to free and open information. While others abandoned their principles for profit, we hold fast to a simple truth: technology should empower everyone, not just the few.

## Our Mission

We exist to advance human-centric AI through radical openness and collaborative innovation. Our work spans multi-agent systems, emergent behaviors, AI social dynamics, and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. We build both theoretical understanding and production-ready systems that bridge research and practice.

## Who We're Looking For

We welcome anyone who shares our vision of human-centric AI and radical openness. Whether you're a:

- **Hacker or Researcher** - Exploring multi-agent systems, emergent behaviors, and AI social dynamics
- **SRE or Software Engineer** - Building production-scale systems that bridge theory and practice  
- **Tinkerer er DIYer** - Taking things apart, figuring out how they work, making them better
- **Artist** - Both audio and visual creators who understand technology as a medium for expression
- **Philosopher** - Thinking deeply about ethics, human agency, and the future we're building
- **Nerd** - Obsessed with understanding how things work and making them work better

If you believe in the hacker ethos that "information wants to be free" and that access to knowledge should be unlimited and total, you belong here.

## Our Values

- **Radical Openness** - Every line of code, every research paper, every breakthrough shared freely
- **Hacker Ethics** - Access to computers and knowledge should be unlimited and total
- **Internet Freedom** - Fighting surveillance capitalism and corporate capture of digital spaces
- **Human-Centric AI** - Technology that augments human intelligence rather than replacing it
- **Collaborative Spirit** - Like IRC channels where ideas flow freely across boundaries
- **Production Reality** - Research that's battle-tested in real systems
- **Collective Ownership** - Individual credit preserved while enabling collaborative support
- **Consensus Building** - Decisions made through discussion, debate, and mutual agreement

## Attribution and Collective Governance

### Project Ownership Models

**Personal Projects Under Eru Labs Umbrella**
- Maintain your project under your own GitHub username to preserve full credit for your work
- Receive support, collaboration, and resources from the Eru Labs collective
- Primary maintainer retains full decision-making authority over their project
- Collective members can choose to support projects that align with their interests and values
- Projects benefit from shared knowledge, code review, and collaborative development

**Eru Labs Organization Projects**
- Group projects initiated and maintained collectively within the Eru Labs GitHub organization
- Decisions made through consensus-based governance with all active contributors
- Members can participate, abstain, or exercise hard blocks on decisions they fundamentally disagree with
- Hard blocks trigger open debate periods to explore concerns and seek consensus
- Project direction determined by active contributors, not passive observers

### Decision-Making Framework

**Consensus Process:**
1. **Proposal** - Any member can propose changes, new directions, or major decisions
2. **Discussion** - Open debate period where concerns are raised and alternatives explored
3. **Refinement** - Proposals are iteratively improved based on feedback
4. **Consensus Check** - Members indicate support, abstention, or hard block
5. **Resolution** - If consensus is reached, decision is implemented; if blocked, return to discussion

**Hard Block Guidelines:**
- Use sparingly and only for fundamental disagreements with project direction
- Must be accompanied by clear reasoning and alternative suggestions
- Triggers extended discussion period to understand concerns
- Community works together to find path forward that addresses blocking concerns

### Attribution Standards

**Research Papers and Publications:**
- Author order determined by contribution effort and intellectual input
- Primary investigators and lead contributors listed first
- All meaningful contributors acknowledged appropriately
- Transparent contribution tracking maintained throughout project lifecycle

**Code and Technical Contributions:**
- Git history and commit attribution preserved across all repositories
- Individual contributions clearly documented and credited
- Collaborative improvements build on original work while respecting authorship
- LICENSE files maintain proper attribution chains

**Collective Support Benefits:**
- Code review and technical mentorship from experienced contributors
- Access to computational resources and testing infrastructure
- Collaborative debugging and problem-solving assistance
- Shared knowledge base and research insights
- Cross-project learning and skill development opportunities
